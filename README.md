# Employee Management
This is a employee management system using [Cosmocloud API](https://cosmocloud.io/), where you can see the **list** of your employees, **add** a new Employee, **update** the employee and even **delete** the employee from your Database.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/supratim50/cosmocloud-emp-management.git
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
 ```

 ## Usage
I have provided a **.env.sample** file. You can simply create your own **.env** file with the **Project Id** and **Environment Id** from [Cosmocloud](https://cosmocloud.io/).
```
VITE_PROJECT_ID=""
VITE_ENVIRONMENT_ID=""
```

To run the project, use the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Thank you.
